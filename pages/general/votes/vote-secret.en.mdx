Creates a secret vote.

## {getLocale("pagesSyntax", "en")}
<TableSyntax page="vote-secret" lang="en" />
## {getLocale("pagesDescription", "en")}

Creates a secret vote with a timer for a limited list of users. Users participating in the voting will receive a personal message from the bot, in which they can choose one of the following options:
- "for" (tick);
- "against" (cross);
- abstained (emoji ðŸ¤”); if you do not choose a reaction within the allotted time, then you will be considered as abstained from answering;
     - "abstained" answer option can be removed in the configuration; in this case, you will be considered as "against".

After all users have a choice or the time runs out, the message shows the result of the vote, but it does not show the choice of each of the participants.

## {getLocale("pageUsageLimitations", "en")}

- From 2 to 16 users can participate in secret vote.
- It is assumed that you are in a public voice channel when using this command. All users present in it participate in voting by default.
     - If you are not in a voice channel, then it will be considered that only you participate in the vote (which will return an error). In this case, you should use the `include`, `exclude` and `only` parameters.

<Swiper page="vote-secret" lang="en" />
